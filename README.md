# TensorFlow_Intro
Working with native TesorFlow.
3 exrecises:
1. simple operation with tensor objects
2. Simple NN for a simple regression problem
3. Build a fully connected NeuralNetwork class with TensorFLow object used to solve exercise 2 above
and for exercise 3 - kaggle Avocado Prices (2020) (https://www.kaggle.com/timmate/avocado-prices-2020) with a fully connected network
